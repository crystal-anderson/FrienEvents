# FrienEvents #

An application for friends to collaborate on events nationwide.

### Description ###

FrienEvents is a flask based app and utilizes TicketMaster's API to search for events nationwide. By displaying returned JSON data with Jinja, users can view event details and add events to a calendar. With the power of AJAX, the calendar displays user data, offers the opportunity to delete events, and add custom events. Users can search for their friends by username, and view their friends calendar as well. This makes the app collaborative and fun, even in last minute planning!
